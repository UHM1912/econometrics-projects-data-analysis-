This repository contains my Econometrics lab assignments, focusing on the application of econometric techniques to different types of data. The purpose of these labs is to gain hands-on experience in analyzing economic and financial data, building statistical models, and interpreting results accurately.

# Topics Covered

- ## Panel Data Analysis
Worked with datasets that track multiple entities (like individuals, firms, or countries) over time. Explored fixed effects, random effects, and other techniques to account for unobserved heterogeneity.

- ## Time Series Analysis
Studied trends, seasonality, and patterns in time-dependent data. Applied moving averages, exponential smoothing, and regression-based forecasting methods to predict future outcomes.

- ## Cross-Sectional Data
Analyzed data collected at a single point in time across multiple individuals or entities. Focused on regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and interpretation of relationships between variables.

- ## Cookâ€™s Distance
Identified influential observations in regression models that could disproportionately affect model estimates. Learned to detect and address outliers to improve model reliability.

- ## Omitted Variable Concept
Explored the effects of leaving out important variables in regression analysis, including bias and inconsistency in parameter estimates. Applied methods to identify and mitigate omitted variable bias.

# Tools & Techniques

- ## Programming Languages:
Python, R

- ## Libraries/Packages:
pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plm (R)

- ## Methods:
Linear regression, multiple regression, diagnostic testing, model validation, data visualization

# Objectives

- Develop a strong understanding of econometric concepts and their practical applications.

- Gain hands-on experience with panel, time series, and cross-sectional datasets.

- Learn to diagnose and correct common issues in regression analysis, such as influential observations and omitted variables.

- Interpret results and provide actionable insights from data-driven models.

- This repository serves as a learning resource for students and enthusiasts interested in practical econometrics and data analysis. It showcases both the theoretical understanding and the practical implementation of key concepts in economics and finance.
